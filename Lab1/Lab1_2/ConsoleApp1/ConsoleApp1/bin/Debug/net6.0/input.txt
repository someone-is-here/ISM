The adults advised me to stop drawing snakes, from the inside or the outside. They told me that it was better to study geography, history, maths and grammar. That’s why, at the age of six, I left a great career as a painter. I did it because my picture number one and picture number two were not successful when adults saw them. Adults never understand anything alone. And children are not happy when they have to always give them explanations.

So I had to choose another profession. I learnt to fly planes. I flew all over the world. And it’s true that geography was very useful to me. I could see the difference between China and Arizona at first look. It is very useful if you are lost in the night.

During my life, I had a lot of contact with many serious people. I lived a lot among the adults. I could see them from a close distance. This experience did not improve my opinion of them much.
